# Click Counter Application

## Overview
This is a simple Python application that functions as a click counter. The counter starts at 0 by default or loads its value from a `.txt` file if available. Users can increment, decrement, reset, and save the counter value through a graphical user interface (GUI). The counter's value is saved to a `.txt` file when requested, and the application reads the file on startup.

## Features
- **Increment**: Adds 1 to the counter.
- **Decrement**: Subtracts 1 from the counter.
- **Reset**: Resets the counter to 0.
- **Save**: Saves the counter value to a `counter.txt` file.
- **Load**: Loads the counter value from `counter.txt` if it exists and contains valid data.

## File Structure
click_counter/ │ ├── main.py # Entry point of the application ├── counter_logic.py # Logic for increment, decrement, and reset operations ├── file_handler.py # Handles file reading and writing ├── ui.py # Creates the graphical user interface └── README.md # Documentation


## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- No external libraries are required (uses `tkinter` for the GUI).

## How to Run
1. Clone or download the project files to your local machine.
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the application:



## Usage
- When the app starts, it attempts to load the counter value from `counter.txt`.
- Use the **Increment** and **Decrement** buttons to modify the counter.
- Use the **Reset** button to reset the counter to 0.
- Use the **Save** button to save the current counter value to `counter.txt`.

## Error Handling
- If `counter.txt` does not exist or contains invalid data, the counter starts at 0.
- Errors during file read/write operations are logged to the console.

## Example
1. Launch the app.
2. Increment the counter to 5.
3. Press **Save** to save the value to `counter.txt`.
4. Close the app and restart it to see the counter resume at 5.
